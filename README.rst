AeroMAPS: Multidisciplinary Assessment of Prospective Scenarios for air transport
====

AeroMAPS is a framework for performing Multidisciplinary Assessment of Prospective Scenarios for air transport. It is intended to become a sectoral Intergrated Assessment Model (IAM) capable of evaluating air transport transition scenarios taking into account technological, sociological, economical and other considerations. It aims to assess the sustainability of simulated prospective scenarios on multiple criteria.

More details can be found in the `official documentation <https://test-cast-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
