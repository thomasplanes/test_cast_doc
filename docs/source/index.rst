AeroMAPS: Multidisciplinary Assessment of Prospective Scenarios for air transport
===================================

AeroMAPS is a framework for performing Multidisciplinary Assessment of Prospective Scenarios for air transport.
It is intended to become a sectoral Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) taking into account technological, sociological, economical and other considerations.
It aims to assess the sustainability of simulated air transport transition scenarios on multiple criteria.

The objective of this documentation is to provide the main elements concerning AeroMAPS.
In particular, check out the :doc:`installation` section for understanding how to use AeroMAPS, the :doc:`documentation` section for understanding the general principles of AeroMAPS, and the :doc:`examples` section for discovering some applications.
