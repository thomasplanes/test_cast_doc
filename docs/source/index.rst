AeroMAPS: Multidisciplinary Assessment of Prospective Scenarios for air transport
===================================

AeroMAPS is a framework for performing Multidisciplinary Assessment of Prospective Scenarios for air transport. It is intended to become a sectoral Intergrated Assessment Model (IAM) capable of evaluating air transport transition scenarios taking into account technological, sociological, economical and other considerations. It aims to assess the sustainability of simulated prospective scenarios on multiple criteria.

The objective of this documentation is to provide the main elements concerning AeroMAPS. In particular, check out the :doc:`General principles` section for obtaining the architecture, methods and models of AeroMAPS, the :doc:`Usage` section for understanding how to use it, and the :doc:`Examples` section for discovering some applications.
